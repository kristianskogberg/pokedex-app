This is a Pokédex application for both Android and IOS devices. Users can search for a Pokémon and the application will fetch data for that Pokémon from Pokédex API. After the data has been loaded the application will display the name of the Pokémon, its type and an image of that Pokémon. The application will also calculate which types the Pokémon is strong against, weak against, resistant to and vulnerable to and display them conveniently.
